=====================
DEAD CODE!!!  DEAD CODE!!!  DEAD CODE!!!  DEAD CODE!!!  DEAD CODE!!!  DEAD CODE!!! 
 
THIS is DEAD CODE!!! It is no longer built, shipped, or used by any of the Hitachi Vantara or Pentaho products.

This project will no longer take community contributions.  All code is contained in the "archive" branch.  Although this code will no longer entertain contributions it is still open source.  Feel free to fork it and use it at will.

This small project contains patches to Hadoop 2 code that allows Windows clients to submit MapReduce jobs to Linux-based Hadoop clusters.
